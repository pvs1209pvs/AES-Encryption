Plain text is read in block of 128/192/256 (depending upon the key size). Encryption is carried on the block of text individually. 

Blocks of plain texts are passed to the thread that is ready to execute and the results the saved in-place. Encrypted text message is achieved once all the blocks of texts are available. 

Data-Parallelism was utilised becasuse the same AES encryption was used on different blocks of text. 

Parallel execution was embarringly parallel because no coordination was required amongst threads which led to almost linear speeedups. 

omp parallel for was used to distribute load amongst the threads.

double check if speedups were linear.
